GalliumOS 1.0 has been released and is available for download immediately:

- [https://galliumos.org/download](https://galliumos.org/download)

Thank you for your support and bug reports on our beta releases! With your help, we've extended full support to nearly all Intel Chromebooks and Chromeboxes. Check [https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility) for details.

## About GalliumOS

GalliumOS is a fast and lightweight Linux distribution specifically for Chromebooks and Chromeboxes. GalliumOS delivers a complete Linux environment with full hardware support and an attractive full-featured desktop.

GalliumOS features a touchpad driver customized for Chromebooks, kernel schedulers optimized for the CPUs and SSDs found in ChromeOS devices, and fixes dozens of device-specific bugs. All while requiring less memory and disk space compared to standard Linux desktop environments.

See [https://wiki.galliumos.org/About_GalliumOS](https://wiki.galliumos.org/About_GalliumOS) for more.

## Installing GalliumOS

GalliumOS installation images can be downloaded from [https://galliumos.org/download](https://galliumos.org/download). You can preview GalliumOS in a "live boot" from the same image without installing. GalliumOS can be installed in place of ChromeOS, or in a dual-boot configuration alongside ChromeOS. See the GalliumOS wiki for full instructions: [https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing).

## Upgrading from GalliumOS Beta Releases

If you already have a beta release of GalliumOS installed, you can upgrade to GalliumOS 1.0 directly.

See [https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Upgrading](https://wiki.galliumos.org/Installing/Upgrading).

## Thank you!

If you've donated to the project, reported issues with the beta releases, answered questions on our support forums, helped spread the word to friends and other news sites, or even just installed and tested GalliumOS, we thank you and hope we will continue to breathe new life into your Chromebooks and Chromeboxes.
